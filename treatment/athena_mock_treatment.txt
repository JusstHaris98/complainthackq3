Here is a step-by-step treatment strategy for a complaint manager to resolve a customer complaint regarding an uncancelled card and unauthorized funds taken from their account, specifically tailored for a UK banking example, with the requested additions.
Complaint Resolution Strategy: Uncancelled Card and Unauthorized Payments
This strategy aims to provide a clear, systematic approach for complaint managers to efficiently and effectively resolve customer issues, ensuring regulatory compliance and customer satisfaction.
Phase 1: Initial Complaint Handling & Acknowledgment
 * Acknowledge and Empathise Immediately:
   * Action: Contact the customer promptly (within 1 working day, as per UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidelines for 'next business day' resolution where possible) to acknowledge receipt of their complaint.
   * Script/Tone: "Thank you for contacting us. I understand this is a frustrating situation, and I'm very sorry to hear about the issues with your card cancellation and the unauthorized transactions. Please be assured I am taking ownership of your case and will investigate this thoroughly."
   * Note: Provide a reference number for their complaint.
 * Gather Comprehensive Information:
   * Action: Confirm all key details with the customer:
     * Date and method of original cancellation request.
     * Card number involved.
     * Specific dates and amounts of unauthorized transactions.
     * Any relevant correspondence (e.g., confirmation of cancellation, previous complaint attempts).
   * Tool: Use the bank's CRM or complaint management system to log all details accurately.
Phase 2: Investigation and Remedial Actions (Card Cancellation & Payments)
 * Verify and Update Customer Address:
   * Action: Access the customer's profile in the bank's system.
   * Check:
     * Confirm the current address on file with the customer.
     * Review the address history for any recent changes (e.g., in the last 3-6 months), as this can sometimes be a red flag for fraud or indicate a missed communication regarding the card.
   * If incorrect or unverified: Promptly update the address in the system, following bank's security protocols for address changes (e.g., verifying with the customer via a secure channel).
   * Rationale: Ensuring correct contact details is crucial for communication and preventing further issues.
 * Verify Card Cancellation Status:
   * Action: Access the bank's core banking system and card management system.
   * Check:
     * Is the card currently showing as 'cancelled' or 'active'?
     * Is there a record of the customer's previous cancellation request? If so, why was it not actioned correctly?
     * If the card was replaced, was the old card properly deactivated?
   * If not cancelled: Immediately initiate the cancellation process for the card, ensuring it is permanently deactivated. Confirm the effective date of cancellation.
   * If already cancelled (but funds still taken): Investigate how transactions were processed post-cancellation. This could indicate a system error, a recurring payment set up directly with a merchant (not via card number), or a delayed processing issue.
 * Identify and Refund Unauthorized Payments & Create Fraud Case:
   * Action:
     * Transaction Review: Scrutinise the customer's account statements for all transactions after the requested cancellation date or after the card should have been inactive.
     * Matching: Cross-reference these with the transactions the customer reported as unauthorized.
     * Beyond Reported: Proactively look for any other suspicious or unauthorized debits, even if not explicitly mentioned by the customer. This demonstrates diligence.
     * Create Fraud Case: If transactions appear unauthorized or fraudulent (e.g., card not physically used by customer, but charges appeared), immediately create a formal fraud case in the bank's fraud management system. This initiates a deeper investigation by the specialist fraud team and triggers the necessary processes for chargebacks if applicable (e.g., via Visa/Mastercard rules).
   * Refund Process:
     * Action: Initiate a full refund for all identified unauthorized transactions.
     * Confirmation: Clearly communicate the total refund amount and the expected timeline for funds to appear in the customer's account.
 * Investigate Root Cause:
   * Action: Determine why the card wasn't cancelled and how payments were taken.
   * Possible causes (UK Banking Context):
     * Human Error: Agent failed to process the cancellation correctly.
     * System Glitch: Technical issue prevented the cancellation from registering.
     * Process Gap: Lack of clear procedure for certain types of cancellations or linking replacement cards.
     * Merchant Direct Debits/Continuous Payment Authorities (CPAs): Some subscriptions or recurring payments are set up as CPAs directly with merchants, meaning they may continue even after a card is cancelled if the merchant has stored the card details securely. This requires the customer to cancel directly with the merchant, but the bank should still assist and explain this.
     * Third-Party Payments: Payments initiated by a third-party app or service that had stored card details.
   * Note: Document the root cause for internal learning and process improvement.
Phase 3: Communication & Resolution
 * Communicate Findings and Actions Clearly:
   * Action: Provide a detailed explanation to the customer (via their preferred method - phone call followed by email/letter) outlining:
     * Confirmation of card cancellation (with date).
     * Details of all transactions identified as unauthorized.
     * Confirmation of the total refund amount and when it will be credited.
     * An explanation of the root cause identified (without using overly technical jargon).
     * Any steps the customer needs to take (e.g., contacting specific merchants for CPAs).
     * Confirmation that a fraud case has been opened and what that means for them.
   * Tone: Maintain an apologetic, empathetic, and professional tone throughout.
 * Offer Apology and Redress (Ex Gratia Payment):
   * Action: Beyond the refund of principal, offer a gesture of goodwill or an ex gratia payment to compensate for the inconvenience, distress, and any out-of-pocket expenses incurred (e.g., bank charges if the unauthorized payments led to overdraft fees).
   * UK Context: The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) often recommends compensation for non-financial detriment. A small amount (£50-£150, depending on severity and duration) is common for significant inconvenience.
   * Rationale: This demonstrates genuine care and can prevent escalation to the FOS.
 * Confirm Satisfaction and Close Complaint:
   * Action: Ask the customer if they are satisfied with the resolution.
   * If Satisfied: Formally close the complaint in the system.
   * If Not Satisfied:
     * Action: Re-engage with the customer to understand remaining concerns.
     * Escalate: If unable to resolve, inform the customer of their right to escalate the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) after 8 weeks (or if the final response is received earlier and they remain unhappy). Provide FOS contact details as per regulatory requirements.
Phase 4: Post-Resolution & Preventative Measures (UK Banking Specific)
 * Internal Process Review & Improvement:
   * Action:
     * Training: Identify if staff training gaps led to the error and provide refresher training on card cancellation procedures and recurring payment types.
     * System Enhancements: Recommend system changes to prevent recurrence (e.g., automated checks, clearer flags for cancellation requests).
     * Policy Review: Review existing policies to ensure they are robust and clear.
     * Data Analysis: Track similar complaints to identify trends and systemic issues.
 * Customer Communication & Education:
   * Suggestion: Proactively educate customers on how recurring payments (especially CPAs vs. Direct Debits) work and how to cancel them.
   * Channels: Include this information in terms and conditions, online FAQs, and during customer service interactions. This helps manage expectations and reduces future similar complaints.
 * Regulatory Reporting:
   * Action: Ensure the complaint and its resolution are accurately logged for regulatory reporting purposes (e.g., to the FCA under DISP rules).
By following these steps, a complaint manager can effectively address the immediate issue, compensate the customer appropriately, and contribute to systemic improvements within the bank.
