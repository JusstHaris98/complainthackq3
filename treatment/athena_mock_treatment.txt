UK Banking Complaint Treatment Plans: Alternative Scenarios
This document outlines 10 additional complaint resolution strategies, each tailored to a specific common issue in the UK banking sector. Each plan adheres to a four-phase structure, ensuring systematic handling, regulatory compliance, and customer satisfaction.
1. Complaint Resolution Strategy: Incorrect Direct Debit/Standing Order Payment
This strategy addresses complaints where a Direct Debit or Standing Order has been paid incorrectly (e.g., wrong amount, duplicate payment, payment after cancellation).
Phase 1: Initial Complaint Handling & Acknowledgment
* Acknowledge and Empathise Immediately:
    * Action: Contact the customer promptly (within 1 working day) to acknowledge receipt.
    * Script/Tone: "Thank you for contacting us. I understand you're concerned about an incorrect payment from your account. I'm sorry for any distress this has caused. I'm taking ownership of your case and will investigate this thoroughly."
    * Note: Provide a reference number.
* Gather Comprehensive Information:
    * Action: Confirm all key details:
        * Type of payment (Direct Debit/Standing Order).
        * Recipient/merchant name.
        * Exact date and amount of the incorrect payment.
        * Expected amount/date, or date of cancellation request if applicable.
        * Any prior communication with the bank or merchant.
    * Tool: Log details in CRM.
Phase 2: Investigation and Remedial Actions
* Verify Mandate/Instruction:
    * Action: Access the bank's core banking system.
    * Check: Verify the original mandate details (amount, frequency, payee) for Direct Debits or the Standing Order instructions.
    * Compare: Cross-reference with the disputed payment.
    * If cancelled: Check the date the cancellation instruction was received and processed.
* Trace Payment:
    * Action: Confirm the payment left the customer's account and reached the intended recipient.
    * Identify Root Cause:
        * Human Error: Incorrect setup/cancellation by bank staff or customer.
        * System Error: Automated system failed to process instruction correctly.
        * Merchant Error: Merchant requested incorrect amount or continued to debit after cancellation (for Direct Debits, the bank can often reclaim on behalf of the customer under the Direct Debit Guarantee).
* Initiate Refund/Correction:
    * Action: If confirmed incorrect (e.g., duplicate, wrong amount, post-cancellation), immediately process a refund for the overpayment or the full incorrect amount. For Direct Debits, activate the Direct Debit Guarantee if applicable.
    * Liaise with Merchant (if necessary): If the error is with the merchant's request, advise the customer to also contact the merchant, or offer to contact them on the customer's behalf where appropriate.
Phase 3: Communication & Resolution
* Communicate Findings and Actions Clearly:
    * Action: Explain: confirmation of refund/correction, root cause, and any steps customer needs to take (e.g., re-establish correct payment, contact merchant).
* Offer Apology and Redress:
    * Action: Offer a goodwill gesture (e.g., £30-£75) for inconvenience, especially if the error caused financial detriment (e.g., overdraft fees) or significant stress.
* Confirm Satisfaction and Close Complaint:
    * Action: Seek customer confirmation of satisfaction. If not, inform of FOS rights.
Phase 4: Post-Resolution & Preventative Measures
* Internal Process Review & Improvement:
    * Action: Review mandate setup/cancellation processes. Provide training to staff on Direct Debit Guarantee rules.
* Customer Communication & Education:
    * Suggestion: Proactively educate customers on how to check/manage Direct Debits/Standing Orders online and the protection offered by the Direct Debit Guarantee.
* Regulatory Reporting:
    * Action: Ensure accurate logging for FCA DISP rules.
2. Complaint Resolution Strategy: Unrecognised Transaction / Transaction Dispute (Non-Fraudulent)
This strategy addresses complaints where a customer does not recognise a legitimate transaction on their statement (e.g., forgotten subscription, family member use, merchant name confusion), distinct from outright fraud.
Phase 1: Initial Complaint Handling & Acknowledgment
* Acknowledge and Empathise Immediately:
    * Action: Contact the customer promptly (within 1 working day) to acknowledge receipt.
    * Script/Tone: "Thank you for contacting us. I understand you've identified a transaction you don't recognise, and this can be concerning. I'm taking ownership of your case and will investigate this thoroughly."
    * Note: Provide a reference number.
* Gather Comprehensive Information:
    * Action: Confirm:
        * Exact date, amount, and merchant name (as appears on statement).
        * Has the customer checked with family members?
        * Have they cancelled any recent subscriptions or trials?
        * Any recent purchases from similar-sounding merchants?
    * Tool: Log details in CRM.
Phase 2: Investigation and Remedial Actions
* Detailed Transaction Analysis:
    * Action: Access transaction details in the core banking system.
    * Check: Look for "trading as" names, associated merchant IDs, and transaction categories. Use internal merchant lookup tools.
* Engage with Customer for Clarification:
    * Action: Provide more detail about the transaction (e.g., location if available, specific time, full merchant descriptor). Prompt the customer with common reasons for unrecognised transactions (e.g., "Could this be for your Netflix subscription?", "Did anyone else in your household use your card?").
* Educate and Empower:
    * Action: Guide the customer on how to resolve the issue directly if it's a known merchant (e.g., cancelling a subscription).
* If still unresolved / Dispute Process:
    * Action: If the customer genuinely cannot identify the transaction and believes it's incorrect, initiate a formal transaction dispute process (chargeback under scheme rules - Visa/Mastercard). This treats it as a disputed purchase, not fraud.
* No immediate refund: Unlike fraud, typically no immediate refund unless the transaction is clearly an error on the bank's part. Refund comes after investigation/chargeback success.
Phase 3: Communication & Resolution
* Communicate Findings and Actions Clearly:
    * Action: Explain: the outcome of the investigation, clarification on the merchant, or the initiation of a dispute/chargeback, including expected timelines.
* Offer Apology and Redress:
    * Action: If the bank's initial descriptor was unclear, or the process was lengthy, consider a small goodwill gesture (£25-£50) for inconvenience.
* Confirm Satisfaction and Close Complaint:
    * Action: Seek customer confirmation of satisfaction. If not, inform of FOS rights.
Phase 4: Post-Resolution & Preventative Measures
* Internal Process Review & Improvement:
    * Action: Review merchant descriptor clarity. Provide training on common unrecognised transaction scenarios.
* Customer Communication & Education:
    * Suggestion: Create clearer online guidance on how to identify transactions, manage subscriptions, and what to do if a transaction is truly unrecognised.
* Regulatory Reporting:
    * Action: Ensure accurate logging for FCA DISP rules.

Phase 1: Initial Complaint Handling & Acknowledgment
* Acknowledge and Empathise Immediately:
    * Action: Contact promptly (within 1 working day).
    * Script/Tone: "Thank you for contacting us. I sincerely apologise for the delays and lack of communication you've experienced with your mortgage application. I understand this is a very stressful time, and I'm taking ownership to get this resolved for you."
    * Note: Provide a reference number.
* Gather Comprehensive Information:
    * Action: Confirm:
        * Mortgage application reference number.
        * Original application date.
        * Key milestones missed (e.g., valuation date, offer date).
        * Specific instances of poor communication (e.g., unreturned calls, vague updates).
        * Any critical deadlines the customer is facing (e.g., house chain, expiry of house offer).
    * Tool: Log details in CRM.
Phase 2: Investigation and Remedial Actions
* Urgent Case Review:
    * Action: Immediately access the mortgage application system.
    * Check: Current status, last action taken, outstanding requirements, individuals assigned, internal notes, service level agreement (SLA) breaches.
* Identify Bottlenecks/Root Cause:
    * Action: Determine why the delay occurred:
        * Understaffing/Workload: High demand, insufficient staff.
        * Missing Information: Customer or third-party (broker, solicitor, valuer) delays in providing documents.
        * System Issue: Technical glitch preventing progress.
        * Process Inefficiency: Unclear internal handovers, bottlenecks.
        * Communication Breakdown: Internal or external (with customer/broker).
* Expedite and Re-prioritise:
    * Action:
        * Assign dedicated case owner: Ensure one person is accountable.
        * Push internally: Contact relevant departments (underwriting, valuations, legal) to expedite the application.
        * Proactive Information Gathering: Reach out to customer/broker for any missing documents.
* Implement Interim Communication Plan:
    * Action: Agree on a communication frequency with the customer (e.g., daily/bi-weekly updates until resolved), even if there's no new information, to manage expectations.
Phase 3: Communication & Resolution
* Communicate Findings and Actions Clearly:
    * Action: Provide specific updates on application progress, estimated timelines, and steps taken to expedite. Explain the root cause of the delay transparently.
* Offer Apology and Redress:

* Confirm Satisfaction and Close Complaint:
    * Action: Seek customer confirmation of satisfaction. If not, inform of FOS rights.
Phase 4: Post-Resolution & Preventative Measures
* Internal Process Review & Improvement:
    * Action: Implement stricter SLA monitoring for mortgage applications. Review staffing levels and training for communication protocols. Streamline internal handovers.
* Customer Communication & Education:
    * Suggestion: Set clear expectations upfront for application timelines. Provide a dedicated point of contact or an online portal for status updates.
* Regulatory Reporting:
    * Action: Ensure accurate logging for FCA DISP rules.

        * Any reason given, however vague.
        * Customer's understanding of why it might have been rejected.
        * Any specific impacts of the rejection on the customer.
    * Tool: Log details in CRM.
Phase 2: Investigation and Remedial Actions
* Access Credit Decisioning System:
    * Action: Review the customer's full loan application, credit bureau data pulled, and the automated decisioning rationale (scorecard results, decline reasons).
* Identify Specific Decline Reason(s):
    * Action: Translate technical decline codes into understandable language. Common reasons:
        * Credit Score: Insufficient score based on bank's criteria.

* Advise on Next Steps (where applicable):
    * Action: If appropriate, suggest actions the customer can take to improve future eligibility (e.g., "You may wish to obtain your credit report to review for any inaccuracies," or "Consider reducing existing credit commitments before reapplying").
Phase 3: Communication & Resolution
* Communicate Findings and Actions Clearly:
    * Action: Provide the clear explanation for the decline (verbally, followed by letter/email). Emphasise that this is a final decision for this application but explain the factors.
* Offer Apology and Redress:
    * Action: Offer an apology for the initial lack of clarity and frustration caused. A small goodwill gesture (£25-£50) may be appropriate if the initial communication was particularly poor or misleading.

    * Identify Discrepancy: A discrepancy between the ATM's physical cash balance and its electronic records will indicate an error.
* CCTV Review (if applicable and available):
    * Action: If the ATM is on bank premises, review CCTV footage of the specific transaction time to corroborate the customer's claim (especially for larger amounts or "too much cash" claims).
* Interim Credit/Hold:
    * Action: If there's strong preliminary evidence of an "under-dispense," consider a temporary credit to the customer's account until the full investigation is complete. If "over-dispense," place a hold on the equivalent amount in the customer's account if possible, or request return.

    * Action: Compare the bank's internal records with the data reported to the CRAs. This may involve pulling a recent data submission report.
    * Identify Discrepancy: Pinpoint if the error originates from the bank's reporting, or if it's an issue with the CRA's display.
* Correcting Bank's Data (if applicable):
    * Action: If the bank's internal records are found to be inaccurate or the reporting to the CRA was incorrect, initiate a data correction request immediately via the appropriate channels (e.g., direct data feed update to the CRA).
* Liaise with Credit Reference Agency (CRA):
    * Action: If the bank's data is correct, but the CRA is displaying it incorrectly, or if the customer has directly contacted the CRA, cooperate fully with the CRA's dispute resolution process. The bank will often be required to confirm or dispute the customer's claim to the CRA.
* Advise Customer on CRA Process:
    * Action: Explain to the customer that credit report updates can take time (e.g., 4-6 weeks) after a correction is submitted. Advise them to regularly check their report directly with the CRA.
Phase 3: Communication & Resolution
* Communicate Findings and Actions Clearly:
    * Action: Explain whether an error was found on the bank's side or the CRA's side. Confirm what action has been taken (e.g., "We have submitted a correction to all three credit reference agencies to update your payment history for that account.") Provide expected timelines for update.
* Offer Apology and Redress:
    * Action: Offer a sincere apology for any incorrect reporting and the anxiety caused. A goodwill payment (£75-£200) is appropriate, especially if the error led to denied credit, increased interest rates, or significant stress.

        * Name Mismatch: Discrepancy between ID and bank records.
        * PEP/Sanctions Flag: False positive or legitimate match requiring deeper review.
        * Complex Structure: For business accounts, complex ownership.
        * Bank Error: System error, incorrect processing by staff.
* Dedicated KYC Support:
    * Action: Liaise directly with the bank's internal KYC/AML team. Assign a specific case handler within that team if possible.

This strategy addresses complaints where a customer has been charged a fee or charge that they believe is incorrect, excessive, or was not clearly communicated (e.g., overdraft fees, international transaction fees, account maintenance fees).
Phase 1: Initial Complaint Handling & Acknowledgment
* Acknowledge and Empathise Immediately:
    * Action: Contact promptly (within 1 working day).
    * Script/Tone: "Thank you for contacting us. I understand you're disputing a fee on your account, and I'm sorry if this charge was unclear or unexpected. I'm taking ownership of your case to investigate this thoroughly."
    * Note: Provide a reference number.
* Gather Comprehensive Information:
    * Action: Confirm:
        * Specific fee type, date, and amount.
        * Why the customer believes the charge is incorrect/unfair.
        * Any prior communication with the bank about this fee or related transactions.
        * Customer's understanding of the terms and conditions related to the fee.
    * Tool: Log details in CRM.
Phase 2: Investigation and Remedial Actions
* Account Transaction Review:
    * Action: Access the customer's account statements and transaction history leading up to the charge.
    * Verify Trigger: Confirm the specific event that triggered the fee (e.g., falling into overdraft, making an international payment, breaching a free transaction limit).
* Review Terms & Conditions (T&Cs):
    * Action: Cross-reference the fee against the relevant product T&Cs and the bank's current tariff of charges.
    * Check Disclosure: Ascertain if the fee was clearly disclosed to the customer at the point of account opening, when the service was used, or through general updates.
* Identify Root Cause (if applicable):
    * Action:
        * Customer Misunderstanding: Fee is valid but T&Cs were unclear.
        * Bank Error: Incorrect application of fee by system or staff.
        * Poor Communication: Bank failed to adequately notify of fee changes or triggers.
        * Exceptional Circumstance: Customer experienced an unusual event (e.g., delayed incoming payment) that led to the fee.
* Process Refund/Waiver:
    * Action: If the fee was applied in error, not clearly communicated, or if there are exceptional mitigating circumstances, immediately process a full refund or waiver of the fee.
    * Discretionary Refund: Consider a discretionary refund, even if technically correct, for goodwill, especially for first-time overdrafts or long-standing customers.
Phase 3: Communication & Resolution
* Communicate Findings and Actions Clearly:
    * Action: Explain: whether the fee was valid, whether it has been refunded/waived, and why (e.g., "The fee was applied correctly as per your T&Cs, but as a gesture of goodwill, we have refunded it for you," or "The fee was applied in error and has been refunded."). Re-explain the fee structure if necessary.
* Offer Apology and Redress:
    * Action: Offer a sincere apology for any confusion or distress. If the fee was incorrectly applied, or the communication was poor, a goodwill payment (£25-£75) may be appropriate in addition to the refund.
* Confirm Satisfaction and Close Complaint:
    * Action: Seek customer confirmation of satisfaction. If not, inform of FOS rights.
Phase 4: Post-Resolution & Preventative Measures
* Internal Process Review & Improvement:
    * Action: Review fee application logic in systems. Enhance staff training on fee structures and communication. Review T&Cs for clarity.
* Customer Communication & Education:
    * Suggestion: Provide clearer, more prominent information on fees (e.g., interactive fee calculators, timely alerts for overdrafts).
* Regulatory Reporting:
    * Action: Ensure accurate logging for FCA DISP rules.
11. Complaint Resolution Strategy: Account Freezing / Access Restriction
This strategy addresses complaints where a customer's bank account has been frozen or access has been restricted, often for compliance, security, or fraud prevention reasons, causing significant disruption.
Phase 1: Initial Complaint Handling & Acknowledgment
* Acknowledge and Empathise Immediately:
    * Action: Contact promptly (within 1 working day).
    * Script/Tone: "Thank you for contacting us. I understand your account has been frozen or access restricted, and I sincerely apologise for the distress and inconvenience this has caused. I'm taking ownership of your case to investigate and resolve this as quickly as possible, within our regulatory obligations."
    * Note: Provide a reference number.
* Gather Comprehensive Information:
    * Action: Confirm:
        * Date and time account access was lost/restricted.
        * Any notification received from the bank.
        * Specific impact (e.g., unable to pay bills, access funds for living expenses).
        * Any unusual recent activity on the account known to the customer.
    * Tool: Log details in CRM.
Phase 2: Investigation and Remedial Actions
* Immediate Internal Escalation & Status Check:
    * Action: Directly contact the Financial Crime, Fraud, or Sanctions team responsible for the freeze.
    * Check: Ascertain the precise reason for the freeze (e.g., suspected fraud, AML flags, court order/restraint order, Cifas marker, security breach).
    * Understand Constraints: Recognise that some reasons (e.g., Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) filed with NCA) legally restrict what the bank can disclose or how quickly they can act.
* Identify Specific Information Required:
    * Action: If permissible, determine exactly what information or documentation is required from the customer to unfreeze the account. This might be proof of funds, source of wealth, explanation of transactions, or identity verification.
* Provide Clear, Permissible Guidance:
    * Action: Communicate to the customer what they need to do, providing clear instructions on documentation and submission methods. If the bank is legally prevented from disclosing the reason (tipping off offence under POCA), explain this limitation.
* Prioritise Case:
    * Action: Push the internal team to prioritise the review of the customer's case and submitted documents.
* Offer Limited Access/Support (if permissible):
    * Action: If possible and safe to do so, arrange for critical payments (e.g., mortgage, rent) to be made via alternative secure channels while the account remains frozen.
Phase 3: Communication & Resolution
* Communicate Findings and Actions Clearly:
    * Action: Explain (to the extent legally allowed) why the account was frozen, what information was needed, and confirm account access has been restored. If the freeze persists, explain why and the ongoing process.
* Offer Apology and Redress:
    * Action: Provide a sincere apology for the significant inconvenience and distress caused, regardless of the reason for the freeze. A substantial goodwill payment (£150-£300+) is often appropriate, especially if the freeze was due to a bank error or prolonged unnecessarily. Compensation for direct financial losses (e.g., missed payments, legal fees) should also be considered.
* Confirm Satisfaction and Close Complaint:
    * Action: Seek customer confirmation of satisfaction. If not, inform of FOS rights.
Phase 4: Post-Resolution & Preventative Measures
* Internal Process Review & Improvement:
    * Action: Review account freezing triggers and processes for accuracy and efficiency. Enhance internal communication protocols between complaint teams and financial crime teams. Improve customer communication templates for such events.
* Customer Communication & Education:
    * Suggestion: Provide clearer public information (online FAQs) about why accounts might be frozen and what customers should do.
* Regulatory Reporting:
    * Action: Ensure accurate logging for FCA DISP rules and relevant financial crime reporting.
12. Complaint Resolution Strategy: Investment Product Suitability / Mis-selling Concerns
This strategy addresses complaints where a customer believes they were sold an investment product that was unsuitable for their needs or that key information was not adequately disclosed (mis-selling).
Phase 1: Initial Complaint Handling & Acknowledgment
* Acknowledge and Empathise Immediately:
    * Action: Contact promptly (within 1 working day).
    * Script/Tone: "Thank you for contacting us. I understand your concerns regarding the suitability of an investment product you purchased and the information provided to you. I take these matters very seriously, and I'm taking ownership of your case to conduct a thorough investigation."
    * Note: Provide a reference number.
* Gather Comprehensive Information:
    * Action: Confirm:
        * Specific investment product name and purchase date.
        * Advisor's name (if known) or branch where advised.
        * Customer's original financial objectives, risk appetite, and circumstances at the time of sale.
        * Specific concerns (e.g., "I was not told about the high fees," "I said I was risk-averse, but this is a high-risk product," "I needed access to my money, but it's locked in").
        * Any documents provided at the time (e.g., fact sheets, illustrations).
    * Tool: Log details in CRM.
Phase 2: Investigation and Remedial Actions
* Retrieve Records of Advice:
    * Action: Access all relevant internal records: client file, Know Your Client (KYC) documents, Suitability Report, Attitude to Risk questionnaire, meeting notes, call recordings, and product disclosure documents given to the customer.
* Assess Suitability & Disclosure:
    * Action: A qualified investment complaint specialist (often a separate team) reviews the advice process against:
        * FCA Conduct of Business Sourcebook (COBS) Rules: Particularly COBS 9 (Suitability) and COBS 4 (Communicating with clients, financial promotions).
        * Customer's Needs: Was the product truly appropriate given their stated risk appetite, objectives, and financial situation?
        * Disclosure: Were all risks, fees, charges, and liquidity issues clearly explained? Was the customer given adequate opportunity to understand?
* Identify Root Cause:
    * Action:
        * Advisor Error: Poor advice, insufficient fact-finding, inadequate explanation.
        * Product Complexity: Product was inherently difficult to explain or understand.
        * Process Failure: Lack of robust suitability checks or training.
        * Customer Misunderstanding: Despite adequate disclosure, customer misinterpreted.
* Determine Remedial Action:
    * Action: If mis-selling is confirmed:
        * Compensation: Aim to put the customer back in the position they would have been had they received suitable advice or not purchased the product. This typically involves refunding losses, fees, and providing interest.
        * Exit Strategy: Assist the customer in exiting the unsuitable investment if possible, minimising further losses.
Phase 3: Communication & Resolution
* Communicate Findings and Actions Clearly:
    * Action: Provide a detailed final response letter, explaining the findings of the suitability assessment, whether mis-selling occurred, and if so, the basis of the compensation calculation.
* Offer Apology and Redress:
    * Action: Offer a sincere apology for the bank's failings (if mis-selling confirmed). Offer compensation for financial loss and non-financial detriment (distress, inconvenience). Compensation can be substantial for investment complaints.
* Confirm Satisfaction and Close Complaint:
    * Action: Seek customer confirmation of satisfaction. If not, inform of FOS rights (customers have 6 months from the final response to refer to FOS).
Phase 4: Post-Resolution & Preventative Measures
* Internal Process Review & Improvement:
    * Action: Enhance advisor training on suitability, disclosure, and compliance. Review suitability assessment processes and tools. Strengthen internal controls and quality assurance on advice.
* Customer Communication & Education:
    * Suggestion: Provide clear, accessible educational materials on investment risks, product types, and the importance of understanding T&Cs.
* Regulatory Reporting:
    * Action: Ensure accurate logging for FCA DISP rules and potential notifications to the FCA about systemic issues.
